# Observed Object Demo 

A demo project to figure out SwiftUI's ObservedObject wrapper. This is the simplist version of this that I could make.

This demo uses CoreData and takes two attributes, `id`, `name`. It will save the name and display the saved name in the list inside of ContentView.swift. That's it.
